## RED HAT APPLICATION SERVICES, RED HAT OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM, AND RELATED SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS


This  Exhibit  1.B.  to  Product  Appendix  1  governs  your  use  of  the  Red  Hat  Application  Services  (formerly  known  as  Red  Hat  JBoss Middleware), Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat Storage Services and Red Hat Quay product lines.

- 1. Unit of Measure and Purchasing Requirements for Red Hat Application Services Subscriptions.

Table 1 sets forth the Units of measure and Supported Use Cases for various Red Hat Application Services Subscriptions.

- 1.1 Supported Application Services. Using Red Hat Application Services Subscription Services to support software obtained from community sites without purchasing a corresponding Subscription for such community software is a material breach of the Agreement.
- 1.2 Red Hat JBoss Core Services Collection. ' Red Hat JBoss Core Services Collection ' is a collection of components that provide common functionality (such as monitoring and management, load balancing, process control and single sign-on) across a majority of the Red Hat Application Services portfolio and is subject to the following terms:
- (a) You will receive entitlements for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Collection in a quantity equal to the number of Cores of Red Hat Application Services Subscriptions you purchased (where the Unit is a Core).
- (b) You will receive entitlements to Red Hat JBoss Core Services Collection equal to sixteen (16) Cores for each Red Hat Application Services Subscriptions you purchase on a per socket-pair basis.
- (c) Red Hat JBoss Web Server does not include Red Hat JBoss Core Services Collection.
- 1.3 Red Hat Application Services for Hybrid Deployments. Subscriptions in Table 1 include access to the Red Hat Application Services Software enabled for and supported on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for both private cloud and public cloud deployment platforms.

## 2. Unit of Measure and Purchasing Requirements for Red Hat OpenShift

Table 2 sets forth the Units of measure, capacity limitations and Supported Use Cases for various Red Hat OpenShift Subscriptions.  You must purchase the appropriate number and type of Subscriptions for each Unit, based on the Unit and other parameters described in Table 2. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Use Case (OCP Use Case as defined below) applies to all Red Hat OpenShift offerings and additional Use Cases apply to the Red Hat OpenShift offerings as noted below.

- 2.1 Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - CoreOS. Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server as included in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform may be deployed using RPM package manager or in a host mode intended to run containers (aka ' Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS ').  Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS mode is an optional image based delivery, deployment and updating mechanism designed to support container based environments.  Each deployment of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, regardless of the method (including containers), constitutes a Unit.
- 2.2 Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation. Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is included with a Red Hat OpenShiftPlatform Plus subscription. Each Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus Cluster is entitled up to 256 TB of storage capacity.  Additional OpenShift Data Foundation storage capacity for Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus Clusters requires the purchase of Red Hat Storage Capacity Expansion Pack for OpenShift Data Foundation and Red Hat Ceph Storage for OpenShift Container Platform.
- 2.3 Red  Hat  OpenShift  Platform  Plus  (without  OpenShift  Container  Platform). Red  Hat  OpenShift  Platform  Plus  (without  OpenShift Container Platform) is an Add-On Subscription that contains Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Essentials and Red Hat Quay and is supported on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, IBM Cloud Paks, Red Hat OpenShift on Amazon and Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift.  You must purchase the appropriate number and type of Add-On Subscription(s) for each Unit in a Cluster, based on the Unit and other parameters of the base Subscriptions described in Table 2 or as described by the aforementioned partner offerings.
- 2.4 Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization. Red Hat OpenShift includes Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization which is designed to run and manage virtual instances.  Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization is supported only when Red Hat OpenShift is installed on the bare metal server and is not installed within a virtual machine.  The included Red Hat Enterprise Linux software is supported solely when used as the guest operating system within virtual machines hosted on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, but not priced or supported when hosted on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine.
- 2.5 Red Hat OpenShift Upgrade and Support Add-On for IBM Cloud Paks. Red Hat offers upgrades for IBM Cloud Paks that include Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform via two Add-On Subscriptions:
- (a) Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus for IBM Cloud Pak (without OpenShift Container Platform) is an Add-On Subscription that upgrades the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform that is included in Cloud Paks to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Plus.
- (b) Red Hat Support for IBM Cloud Pak (for Red Hat OpenShift only) Subscriptions upgrade the original Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for IBM Cloud Pak Subscription entitlements by (i) enabling the Client to directly contact Red Hat for Support (Standard or Premium) and (ii) providing Support for general-purpose workloads.

Client agrees to purchase both Add-On Subscriptions in a quantity at least equal to the number of deployed Units across Clusters.

- 2.6 Red  Hat  OpenShift  Virtualization  Engine. Red  Hat  OpenShift  Virtualization  Engine  is  designed  to  create,  run  and  manage  virtual machines.  Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine includes additional entitlements to run third-party utilities (such as storage, monitoring, and management) that provide common functionality to the Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine cluster infrastructure.
