## 1.2 Use of Subscription Services.

- (a)(i) Basis of the Fees. While you have a Subscription entitling you to receive Subscription Services for a Red Hat Product, you are required to purchase  the  applicable  Subscriptions  in  a  quantity  equal  to  the  total  number  and  capacity  of  Units  for  that  Subscription  from  the commencement of your use or deployment of such Subscription or a part thereof.  For purposes of counting Units, Units include non-Red Hat products if you are using Subscription Services to support or maintain such non-Red Hat products.  The fees are for Subscription Services; there are no fees associated with the Red Hat Software licenses.  An instance of a Red Hat Universal Base Image by itself (e.g., not combined or used with Red Hat Subscriptions) is not considered a Unit unless such instance receives or uses Subscription Services.
- (a)(ii) CPUs, Cores, Sockets and AI Accelerators. For Units, and the capacities associated with Units, that are based on processors running the Software (such as Physical Nodes, Virtual Nodes, CPU, Cores, and AI Accelerators), you are required to purchase Subscriptions that match the type of processor running such Software.  For example, if you are running OpenShift AI on an AI Accelerator, you are required to purchase an equivalent number of AI Accelerator based Subscriptions. Subscriptions that do not specify a processor type are based on x86 processors.
- (b) Supported Use Cases. Subscription Services are only provided when the Software is used for Supported Use Cases as described in this Section 1.2 and the Exhibits to this Product Appendix. The Supported Use Cases also determine the type of Subscription that is required. Software Subscriptions are supported on x86 and ARM architectures, unless a different architecture is specified in which case only the specified architecture is supported.  If your use of any aspect of the Subscription Services is contrary to or conflicts with a Supported Use Case, you are responsible for purchasing the appropriate Subscriptions to cover such usage. For example, if you are using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop Subscription on a System that is a server, you are obligated to purchase a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server Subscription.

- (c) Development and Production Uses. This  Section  describes  four  types  of  activities  (Demonstration  Activities;  Individual  Coding  and Testing Activities; Multi-User Development, Test and Integration Activities; and Deployment Activities).  Those terms are defined in the Definitions section below and each is categorized as either a Development Use or a Production Use, based on the Red Hat Product to which the activities are associated.  ' Development Use' ' means the activities set forth in Table 1.2(c) identified as development use; and also includes creating software that functions as an extension to or an integration with a Red Hat Product (e.g. OpenShift operator or Ansible integrations).  ' Production  Use '  means  those  activities  identified  as  Production  Use  in  the  Table  below  and  any  use  other  than  for Development Use. Development Use and Production Use are used in numerous Use Cases in the attached Exhibits to describe the type of Subscription Services available.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Development Use and Production Use both exclude Unauthorized Subscription Services Uses (defined in Section 1.2(g) below.
- (d) Service Levels. You agree not to request or use higher support services levels for Software Subscriptions where you have purchased Subscriptions with lower Service Levels (as described in Section 2.4(d) below)), and agree to purchase the highest support level that you use or request.  For example, if a Cluster of nodes requires the Service Level, all of the nodes in that Cluster require the highest Service Level.
- (e) Transferring Subscriptions. You may reallocate Subscriptions within or between entities operating under the Agreement provided you are accountable for the number and types of Units.
- (f) Scope of Use of Subscription Services. The  Agreement  (including  pricing)  is  premised  on  the  understanding  that  you  will  access Subscription Services only for your internal use (which may include Affiliates other than any entities in Russia, Belarus or jurisdictions prohibited  under  United  States  law)  and  you  agree  not  to  access  Subscription  Services  for  any  other  purpose.    Your  internal  use  of Subscription Services may include running a web site, offering your own software as a service or integrating AI functionality into your application  which  is  accessible  by  your  users,  provided  that  (i)  such  use  does  not  include  a  distribution,  sale  or  resale  of  any  of  the Subscription Services, (ii) the primary purpose of such use is to provide a material value added application other than the Subscription Services, (iii) the Subscription Services are supporting Software installed on hardware or cloud instances controlled by you, and (iv) all Subscription  Services  provided  by  Red  Hat  will  be  provided  solely  to  you  or  third  parties  acting  on  your  behalf  (such  as  contractors, subcontractors, or outsourcing vendors) and not to your hosted customers.  You agree not to provide Subscription Services to, or use them for the benefit of, a third party (such as, using Subscription Services to provide hosting services, managed services, or Internet service provider (ISP) services).  Subscription Services may be used by third parties acting on your behalf, such as contractors or outsourcing vendors, provided you (i) are fully responsible for the activities and omissions of the third parties acting on your behalf and (ii) in the case of a migration to a third party cloud or hosting provider, are qualified for and comply with the terms of the Red Hat Cloud Access program as set forth in Section 3 below.
