      Basis of the Fees. While you have a Subscription entitling you to receive Subscription Services for
      a Red Hat Product, you are required to purchase the applicable Subscriptions in a quantity equal to
      the total number and capacity of Units for that Subscription from the commencement of your use or deployment
      of such Subscription or a part thereof. For purposes of counting Units, Units include non-Red Hat products
      if you are using Subscription Services to support or maintain such non-Red Hat products. The fees are for
      Subscription Services; there are no fees associated with the Red Hat Software licenses. An instance of a
      Red Hat Universal Base Image by itself (e.g., not combined or used with Red Hat Subscriptions) is not
      considered a Unit unless such instance receives or uses Subscription Services.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How should you determine the number of Subscriptions to purchase?
        answer: |
          You must purchase Subscriptions in a quantity equal to the total number and capacity of Units being used.
      - question: |
          Are non-Red Hat products counted as Units for Subscription purposes?
        answer: |
          Yes, non-Red Hat products are counted as Units if they are supported or maintained using Subscription Services.
      - question: |
          What are the Red Hat Subscription fees charged for?
        answer: |
          The fees are charged for Subscription Services, not for Red Hat Software licenses.
      - question: |
          Is an instance of a Red Hat Universal Base Image considered a Unit by itself?
        answer: |
          No, an instance of a Red Hat Universal Base Image is not considered a Unit unless it receives or uses Subscription Services.
  - context: |
      CPUs, Cores, Sockets and AI Accelerators. For Units, and the capacities associated with Units,
      that are based on processors running the Software (such as Physical Nodes, Virtual Nodes, CPU,
      Cores, and AI Accelerators), you are required to purchase Subscriptions that match the type of
      processor running such Software. For example, if you are running OpenShift AI on an AI Accelerator,
      you are required to purchase an equivalent number of AI Accelerator based Subscriptions.
      Subscriptions that do not specify a processor type are based on x86 processors.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What must be purchased to match the type of processor running the Software?
        answer: |
          Subscriptions matching the processor type must be purchased.
      - question: |
          What types of units are mentioned that are based on processors running the Software?
        answer: |
          Physical Nodes, Virtual Nodes, CPUs, Cores, and AI Accelerators are mentioned.
      - question: |
          What is required when running OpenShift AI on an AI Accelerator?
        answer: |
          An equivalent number of AI Accelerator-based Subscriptions must be purchased.
      - question: |
          What are subscriptions based on if they do not specify a processor type?
        answer: |
          They are based on x86 processors.
  - context: |
      For AI Products you may input questions or prompts into an interface (Input).
      The Input is passed to a large language model (LLM) that provides responses or suggestions (Output).
      The Output may require additional modifications to be useful and any such modifications are "Modified Output".
      Red Hat does not claim any intellectual property rights with respect to Input, Output, or Modified Output.
      Your use of Output and Modified Output is at your discretion and Red Hat makes no warranties or guarantees
      with respect to Output or Modified Output. You are responsible for ensuring your use of any LLM or other
      AI model complies with any applicable laws and regulations.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What term is used when changes are made to the Output from an AI Product?
        answer: |
          When changes are made to the Output, it is referred to as Modified Output.
      - question: |
          Does Red Hat claim intellectual property rights over Input, Output, or Modified Output?
        answer: |
          No, Red Hat does not claim any intellectual property rights over Input, Output, or Modified Output.

          The responsibility for compliance with applicable laws and regulations lies with the user of the Output or Modified Output.
      - question: |
          Does Red Hat guarantee the accuracy or usefulness of the Output or Modified Output?
        answer: |
          No, Red Hat makes no warranties or guarantees regarding the Output or Modified Output.

  This document, Product Appendix 1, outlines the Software and Support Subscriptions offered by Red Hat,
  serving as an extension of their base agreement. It defines various Units used to measure software usage
  and determine subscription fees, such as Cores, Sockets, and Nodes, explaining how these units apply to
  different products and deployments, including those on public clouds. The appendix specifies Supported
  Use Cases for each subscription, detailing the environments and scenarios where technical support is provided
  and clarifying the distinction between Development Use and Production Use. Additionally, it describes
  the various Support options available, including different Service Levels and specialized support offerings
  like Technical Account Management and Developer Support, while also outlining the limitations of these
  services and terms related to using Red Hat's Cloud Access program and AI Products.
